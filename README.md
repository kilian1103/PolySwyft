# Nested sampling Neural Ratio estimator (NSNRE)

# PolySwyft

An implementation of a Nested Sampling Neural-Ratio-Estimator (NSNRE) using ``pypolychord``
and ``swyft`` named ``PolySwyft``in ``pytorch``.

This repository contains a self-contained example of ``PolySwyft`` that is executed via the ``main_xxx.py`` files.

For anyone wanting to have a more customisable version of the code, please refer to the notebook
``main.ipynb``. This notebook contains the same workflow as the ``main_xxx.py`` files, but is more modular and allows for easier experimentation.
